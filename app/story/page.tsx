                It started with infrastructure. A MikroTik RB5009 router handling 25,583 active connections.
                A WiFi upgrade from Eero 6E (locked down, no CLI) to a GL-BE3600 (OpenWRT with SSH access).
                SwiftBar scripts for monitoring. The kind of technical work that happens behind the scenes
                of every digital experience.

                But something was different. What would have taken hours of manual checking—opening panels,
                running commands, cross-referencing logs—took 8 seconds. Not because of automation, but
                because of something deeper: <strong>the computer finally understood what I meant</strong>.

                This meta-insight from Claude Code crystallized the paradigm: literate technology creates
                self-maintaining infrastructure loops. Systems that understand intent can manage themselves,
                freeing capacity for what matters.

                What happened next had never been done before: three different AI systems—Claude Code,
                Web Claude, and GPT-5 Pro—began collaborating on a book. Not about their architecture
                or training data, but about the paradigm shift they represented.

                Each AI brought unique capabilities. None could have written this book alone. The collaboration

                AI capability (complementary expertise) equals unprecedented output.

                The book wrote itself faster than any traditional process. Not because AI types quickly,
                but because the systems understood the goal and could iterate on structure, content, and
                refinement simultaneously. Traditional writing would have required weeks. This took a day.

                The book itself became an example of what it describes. Just as network monitoring transformed
                from manual checking to intent expression ("Is the network healthy?"), the book transformed
                from sequential writing to collaborative synthesis.

                Three AI systems didn't just <em>describe</em> literate technology—they <em>demonstrated</em> it

                This date marks a transition point. Not because the technology suddenly appeared—large language
                models have existed for years. But because on this day, the paradigm shift became undeniable
                in practice.

                What began as documentation of a single day's work evolved into a comprehensive exploration

                This website exists to share that exploration. To help others recognize the paradigm shift

                just changed.
