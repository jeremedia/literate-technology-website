# Frontend Design Skill Guide

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## For the Literate Technology Website

### Recommended Aesthetic Direction: "Editorial Futurism"
- **Typography-First**: The book is about language - make typography the hero
- **Magazine Layout**: Asymmetric grids, pull quotes, dramatic whitespace
- **Future-Retro**: Blend early computing aesthetics with modern minimalism
- **Monospace Accents**: Terminal/code references throughout
- **High Contrast**: Pure blacks and whites with electric accent colors

### Specific Choices
- **Display Font**: Editorial serif like Crimson Pro or Playfair Display
- **Body Font**: Clean, readable serif like Literata or Source Serif
- **Code Font**: JetBrains Mono or IBM Plex Mono
- **Color Palette**:
  - Deep black (#000000) and pure white (#FFFFFF)
  - Electric blue accent (#0EA5E9) for interactive elements
  - Terminal green (#00FF41) for success states
  - Warning amber (#F59E0B) for comparisons

### Key Visual Elements
- **Hero Animation**: Typewriter effect showing "intent → action" transformation
- **Capacity Visualization**: Animated multiplication showing 60× in real-time
- **Chapter Cards**: Large typography with hover-triggered excerpts
- **Reading Progress**: Minimal line indicator that follows scroll
- **Interactive Demos**: Terminal-style interfaces with modern polish

### Motion Strategy
- **Page Load**: Staggered reveal of sections with subtle fade-ups
- **Scroll Triggers**: Chapters appear as you approach them
- **Hover States**: Reveal depth - show excerpts, animate numbers
- **Transitions**: Quick, purposeful, no unnecessary delays

### Avoid These Clichés
- Generic purple gradients
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, system fonts)
- Predictable centered layouts
- Cookie-cutter components
- AI-generated feel

### Make It Memorable
- The 60× animation should be DRAMATIC
- Typography should feel like opening a beautifully printed book
- Interactive elements should respond with terminal-like precision
- The whole site should demonstrate "literate technology" in its behavior

Remember: This website documents a paradigm shift. Make it feel like one.
