# Chapter 0: What We Mean by Literate Technology

## Opening Example
You ask a system, “Show me a one-screen view of my network health, and tell me if anything needs attention.” You do not specify CLI flags or GUI click paths. You articulate intent in plain language. The system explores available interfaces, gathers the needed signals, drafts a compact summary, and offers a short list of next actions you can accept or refine.

## Core Concept
Literate Technology (LT) refers to systems that process, interpret, and generate human language with high proficiency, then map that language to meaningful actions or representations. LT is about **computable literacy**: vocabulary, fluency, comprehension, and writing. It is not about consciousness or wisdom. It is about useful language behavior that supports your intent.

Computers were always capable. We just could not speak their language. With LT, the language is ours.

## The Four Facets of Literacy
**Vocabulary.** An LT system recognizes domain terms, synonyms, and paraphrases, and can select precise words when presenting results.

**Fluency.** The system communicates with clarity and rhythm. It reduces unnecessary steps. It proposes next actions in compact, unambiguous language.

**Comprehension.** It identifies what you are trying to accomplish, draws context across multiple sources, and surfaces the right level of detail.

**Writing.** It produces new artifacts you can use: scripts, summaries, commands, diagrams, and documentation. The outputs are actionable, not just pretty text.

## Capability vs. Cognition
Literate Technology can represent and act on patterns of language and action. It does not have subjective experience. It follows patterns, constraints, and checks that you install. Treat it as a high-bandwidth language instrument, not a mind.

## Why This Framing Helps
- **Precision.** LT focuses on language capability rather than broad “intelligence”.
- **Expectation management.** You get a useful partner in articulation and action, not an oracle.
- **Responsible development.** You design guardrails and verification paths that match the real risks.

## LT in Action, Grounded in Infrastructure
When you say, “Give me a 30-second refresh of WAN throughput, CPU temp, packet loss, and any router alerts,” an LT-enabled workflow can: discover the right interfaces, produce a SwiftBar script, and format outputs for quick scanning. The capability existed before. LT reduces the translation tax between your intent and the computer’s mechanisms.

## Practical Patterns
- Lead with intent in natural language.
- Ask for artifacts you can run or re-use: scripts, commands, dashboards.
- Require verifiable steps and short summaries.
- Close the loop: after execution, ask for an explanation of what changed and why.

## Common Pitfalls
- Attributing human beliefs or motives to LT.
- Treating conversational output as truth without verification when stakes are high.
- Burying intent under tool names and flags instead of describing the outcome you want.

## Summary
- LT is computable literacy: vocabulary, fluency, comprehension, and writing.
- It turns your natural language into concrete actions and artifacts.
- It is not consciousness. It is a disciplined interface for intent.
- Use it to shrink the translation tax between what you want and what the machine can already do.
